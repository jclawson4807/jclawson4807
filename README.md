# üëã Hello! My name is Jim Clawson.

I am a programmer with more than 30 years of experience as a professional software developer. I also know when I do not know something, and can learn new techniques, technologies, design patterns, or programming languages quickly. Much of my career has been spent adopting and completing failed projects, which has taught me to work with stakeholders, perform needs analysis, write clear and concise documentation, and to build projects based on a critical features first approach. My experience as an enterprise software developer and system architect allows me to consider the larger platform or product‚Äôs purpose and requirements while designing and building subsets of application features. I am also an experienced team leader of local, hybrid, and remote teams. I have built and managed geo-redundant AWS deployments which have supported millions of simultaneous users.

I am also a student at [Brigham Young University Idaho](https://www.byui.edu), studying computer science. I last attended BYU Provo staring in 1991, and the technology used throughout the world has changed since that time. Though I have worked to learn current software development languages and tools, I decided it was time to return to school, and so I enrolled through [BYU Pathway](https://www.byupathway.edu).

Outside of my work and educational pursuits, I am the husband of an amazing, wonderful, and faith-filled woman, we are the parents of three children. We are members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng).

üè¢ I'm currently a founding partner at morpheUS innovations, a company which provides contract software development, auditing, needs analysis, and team management services. I am passionate about medical research, data processing architectures, and ML driven process automation.
üå± I love doing family history research, and am currently working on a not-for-profit family history organization and web site. Details will be provided soon.
üí¨ I like to do missionary work and talk about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am also very interested in software development using Python, HTML5 with vanilla Javascript, C#, and custom AI development. I am doing research on a revision of a data vectorization system I designed in the mid 90s.
