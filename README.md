# üëã Hello! My name is Jim Clawson.

I am a programmer with more than 30 years of experience as a professional software developer. I also know when I do not know something, and can learn new techniques, technologies, design patterns, or programming languages quickly. Much of my career has been spent adopting and completing failed projects, which has taught me to work with stakeholders, perform needs analysis, write clear and concise documentation, and to build projects based on a critical features first approach. My experience as an enterprise software developer and system architect allows me to consider the larger platform or product‚Äôs purpose and requirements while designing and building subsets of application features. I am also an experienced team leader of local, hybrid, and remote teams. I have built and managed geo-redundant AWS deployments which have supported millions of simultaneous users.

I am also a student at [Brigham Young University Idaho](https://www.byui.edu), studying computer science. I attended BYU Provo staring in 1991, and the technology used throughout the world has changed since that time. Though I have worked to learn current software development languages and tools, I decided it was time to return to school, and so I enrolled through [BYU Pathway](https://www.byupathway.edu).

Outside of my work and educational pursuits, I am the husband of an amazing, wonderful, and faith-filled woman, and we are the parents of three children. We are members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng).

üè¢ I am a founding partner at morpheUS innovations, a company which provides contract software development, auditing, needs analysis, and team management services. I am passionate about medical research, data processing architectures, and ML driven process automation.

üå± I love doing family history research, and managed a not-for-profit family history research company for more than seven years. I am developing a new site which will help teach people how to do family history research, and which will provide a community for collaborative research. The site, which has not launched publicly yet, can be seen at [familyheritagediscovery](https://jclawsonopal.github.io/familyheritagediscovery/).

üí¨ I like to do missionary work and talk about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am also very interested in software development using Python, HTML5 with vanilla Javascript, C#, and custom AI development. I am doing research on a revision of a data vectorization system I designed in the mid 90s.

Over the years, I have been the principle inventor on three issued patents, and have been a co-author or ghost writer of sorts on many others. I am working on, or have plans for, eight new patents. Here are the abstracts and patent numbers for two of my patents.

Patent abstract
(US Patent US6112304A)

A method and system for utilizing resources according to a novel computing architecture are provided, including an operational environment for denizen processes and a way for denizens to travel between locations. A denizen process is capable of receiving instructions, evaluating different locations in the operational environment in view of the received instructions, selecting a location based on that evaluation, moving itself to the selected location, and executing at least a portion of the received instructions at the selected location. To avoid distributing viruses and to reduce bandwidth requirements, denizens can move by specifying information for building a denizen by using code stored in a library at a destination location. The denizen is also capable of reproducing and archiving itself, of detecting an error in itself, and of attempting to replace itself with an archived version of itself or attempting to rebuild itself from library components. In addition, the denizen is capable of modifying itself by dynamically loading and unloading code. Denizens can flexibly allocate processors because each denizen can individually decide where it should execute. Application areas for employing the novel architecture include database management and natural language translation.

Patent Abstract
(US Patent 2020/0136805 A1)

A method may include obtaining first and second sets of block chain modifications from first and second exchange servers, respectively. The method may additionally include parsing the sets of block chain modifications to identify attributes associated with a first block chain modification included in the first set of block chain modifications, and automatically correlating the first block chain modification with a second block chain modification included in the second set of block chain modifications as corresponding components of an exchange associated with the first user. The method may additionally include flagging both the first and second block chain modifications based on the automatic correlation, and generating a report of the sets of block chain modifications that excludes the flagged block chain modifications.
