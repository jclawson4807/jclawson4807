# üëã Hello! My name is Jim Clawson.

With over 30 years as a software developer and system architect, I excel at rescuing failed projects by collaborating with stakeholders, conducting needs analysis, and prioritizing critical features. I lead local, hybrid, and remote teams to deliver scalable, geo-redundant AWS deployments supporting millions of users, rapidly adopting new technologies and design patterns to meet project goals.

üè¢ I am a founding partner at morpheUS innovations, a company which provides contract software development, auditing, needs analysis, and team management services. I am passionate about medical research, data processing architectures, and ML driven process automation.

Many of my recent projects have been ML/AI focused. I developed ML/AI solutions using ChatGPT and YOLO to extract and process data from documents and images, generating structured JSON and reports stored in PostgreSQL. I have also used several multi-modal models to create RAG applications, text analysis tools, and more. Langchain and Hugging Face are wonderful resources. I am very excited about the new Foundation Model APIs in macOS 26 and the related OS versions for mobile and Vision OS platforms. They will allow me to accomplish much of the extraction and organization processes I now do with Python with fewer lines of code in Swift using language native patterns and tools.

I began studying at BYU Provo in 1991 and, after a 30-year career as a software developer, am now pursuing a computer science degree at [Brigham Young University Idaho](https://www.byui.edu) via [BYU Pathway](https://www.byupathway.edu) to deepen my knowledge of modern development practices. I hope to complete an advanced degree over the next ten years, and give back to BYU by teaching at one of the BYU schools or online through BYU Pathway.

Outside of my work and educational pursuits, I am the husband of an amazing, wonderful, and faith-filled woman, and we are the parents of three children. We are members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng).

üå± I love doing family history research, and managed a not-for-profit family history research company for more than seven years. I am developing a new site which will help teach people how to do family history research, and which will provide a community for collaborative research. The Family Heritage Discovery site is under development and not yet publicly launched. You can view the site in its current state of development at [familyheritagediscovery](https://jclawsonopal.github.io/familyheritagediscovery/).

üí¨ I like to do missionary work and talk about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am also very interested in software development using Python, HTML5 with vanilla Javascript, C#, and custom AI development. I am doing research on a revision of a data vectorization system I designed in the mid 90s.

Over the years, I have been the principal inventor on several patents, and have been a co-author or ghost writer of sorts on many others. I am working on, or have plans for, eight new patents. Here are the abstracts and patent numbers for two of my patents.

Patent abstract
(US Patent US6112304A)

A method and system for utilizing resources according to a novel computing architecture are provided, including an operational environment for denizen processes and a way for denizens to travel between locations. A denizen process is capable of receiving instructions, evaluating different locations in the operational environment in view of the received instructions, selecting a location based on that evaluation, moving itself to the selected location, and executing at least a portion of the received instructions at the selected location. To avoid distributing viruses and to reduce bandwidth requirements, denizens can move by specifying information for building a denizen by using code stored in a library at a destination location. The denizen is also capable of reproducing and archiving itself, of detecting an error in itself, and of attempting to replace itself with an archived version of itself or attempting to rebuild itself from library components. In addition, the denizen is capable of modifying itself by dynamically loading and unloading code. Denizens can flexibly allocate processors because each denizen can individually decide where it should execute. Application areas for employing the novel architecture include database management and natural language translation.

Patent Abstract
(US Patent 11838404)

A method may include obtaining first and second sets of block chain modifications from first and second exchange servers, respectively. The method may additionally include parsing the sets of block chain modifications to identify attributes associated with a first block chain modification included in the first set of block chain modifications, and automatically correlating the first block chain modification with a second block chain modification included in the second set of block chain modifications as corresponding components of an exchange associated with the first user. The method may additionally include flagging both the first and second block chain modifications based on the automatic correlation, and generating a report of the sets of block chain modifications that excludes the flagged block chain modifications.

**Team Building and Training**

I have had the opportunity to build and lead several teams. These teams include combinations of developers, project managers, UI and UX experts, manual and automated QA specialists, and SMEs. All senior team members are involved in training junior team members in the same skill area, both through direct instruction and team/pair programming.

I am a proponent of cross skill training, and have members of the team lead skill training for their entire team each week during our SCRUM meeting. This skill training often includes practical exercises. These presentations are recorded and available to team members as an educational library hosted in Notion. This library is reviewed by a team leader in a specific area of expertise on a quarterly basis to ensure that the skills taught therein are relevant and current. This review assignment rotates each quarter. I provide access to online learning tools, ranging from Udemy or other online classes to formal certification training and testing programs, for employees to use on their own time, and provide incentives, such as bonuses or opportunities for advancement, to team members to learn new skills and get certifications. This skill training process allows us to prevent project delays when a team member has to take time off due to health or PTO, or when a key employee leaves the company. It also results in higher employee retention since junior employees see a path to more senior positions in the company and are provided with the tools and a well defined path for advancement. The process also allows senior team leaders to see how well employees understand and learn skills -both within their current areas of expertise and in areas they may not have previously had experience. I have found exceptional developers from other areas of expertise, and also found UX experts who were eventually moved into product owner positions because they understood the product and our customers so well, and were discovered to have excellent project management skills. Additionally, this process helps people in one area of specialization understand what other people on the team do, the amount of effort and skill required to do their jobs, and to some extent, the load that each group is carrying. This increased understanding reduces conflict between team members, increases efficiency of cross speciality collaboration, and allows us to project project timelines more effectively.

People with senior positions for each skill area are involved in documentation and product design as needed. This ensures that we don‚Äôt have product requirements or dependencies that our team is not prepared for. If a new project requires that we use a technology or integrate with an API or other resource with which we are not familiar, one or more team members are assigned to learn that new technology and document their learning experience. That document becomes part of our educational library, and is always part of our skills training.

When beginning a role with a new company or department, I document my questions and the answers to those questions, any new policies I learn about, and any other relevant information. I then use that information to create an onboarding guide for new hires.

Note that training efforts are incorporated into sprint schedules. I use collapsable sprint schedules, meaning that items of lower priority such as team training exercises are automatically moved to the next sprint in situations where we receive an urgent or high priority assignment which supersedes lower priority items in the sprint.
